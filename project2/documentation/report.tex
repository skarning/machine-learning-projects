\section{Introduction}
This project will try to find data pre-processing methods and a neural network that best predicts the buying price of a car, based on the car evaluation dataset.
It will also compare performance and anccuracy between decision trees and neural networks on this dataset.
\subsection{Related work}
There are numerous articles that have studied the performance of different modeling techniques with respect to the car evaluation dataset. The article by Sameer Singh\cite{singh2005modeling} discusses the performance of varying training set sizes for different classification methods for the car evaluation sets. Sameer used artificial neural networks, K-nearest neighbour, decision trees and support vector machines in order to classify the acceptability of each car.


An article\cite{perf} also explored the performance of data mining classification methods. Here the authors also focus on the pre-processing of the data. They discuss concepts like data-cleaning, data-transformation and splitting of the data-set.
